## Description
This program will automatically generate a README.md file for you as you answer a series of questions. If you would like to skip a section, all you have to do is leave the answer blank when the question comes up, then it won't show up in the README.md! While I was creating this I actually learned a little about how the asynchronous nature of Javascript can sometimes leave undesired consequences, but thankfully I was able to overcome those difficulties.
